            <p>
              Hi, I'm Harry! I'm a third year studying Advanced CS, and I love
              all things tennis (click the tennis ball)! One of my favourite
              memories at UNSW was playing for the UniSport Men's National Team
              in Canberra. Everyone was super cracked and it was a lot of fun. I
              also like playing chess (and lots of other games), although I'm
              definitely worse at chess than I am at tennis. I'm completely new
              to frontend, but I'm taking COMP6080 in 26T1. Random fun fact:
              back in the day I used to be ranked no. 1 in Australia in Brawl
              Stars. You can also check out my chess.com profile here:

              A small side project exploring match prediction using ML and
              historical tennis data. Still a work in progress lol nothing crazy
              yet, but I’m learning a lot!

            <h2>Why DevSoc?</h2>
            <p>
              I’m keen to join DevSoc mainly to get hands-on experience building
              real web applications and working on something that actually gets
              used. I’ve done a lot of coursework, but I want to get better at
              turning ideas into something real. I also really miss that feeling
              of coding in a team and I think DevSoc would be a great place to
              build alongside other motivated people.
